              <p className="detail__info-txt">Charm Accessories jewellery
                are made from either
                 Silver or Gold plated brass with
                Rhinestone crystals. To care for the
                crystals, wash in warm water and then pat dry
                with a soft, clean cloth. Avoid using chemicals
                and soaps as these will leave a residue on the cystals,
                causing them to become duller more quickly. On the silver
                plated metal, use a high-quality jewellery cleaner and tarnish
                remover. Gold plated jewellery requires less frequent
                cleaning. Jewellery should be stored away from natural
                sunlight. Use the protective jewellery box or tarnish-resistant
                pouch purchased with the jewellery. Do not use
                plastic bags as these can make silver tarnish faster.
