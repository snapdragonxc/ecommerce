            <h3>Shipping & Delivery</h3>
            <p>We provide free shipping to anywhere in Australia via Australia Post</p>
            <p>All deliveries should arrive within 3 to 5 working days (except WA & TAS, which could
              take up to 7 working days) from your date of order. If your product has not arrived
              within this time frame, you can track your order using the Australia Post tracking
              number provided to you via email.</p>
            <p>We do not currently ship internationally? You’ll only be able to process an order on
              our site if your shipping and billing addresses are in Australia.</p>
            <h3>Exchanges & Returns</h3>
            <p>If you wish to return an item simply because you change your mind, we will
              gladly exchange or refund, provided that the item is in original condition, unworn and
              with tags still attached. In the interests of hygiene and for your protection we do
              not accept returns of, or provide refunds for pierced earrings, packs containing
              earrings, body jewellery and hair accessories unless the items are of unsatisfactory
              quality.
            </p>
            <p>If you’d like a refund or exchange then you will be expected to pay for
              shipping the item back to us. We do not cover postage costs for returning items.</p>
            <h3>Payments</h3>
            <p>The PayPal method we use will also accept payments by Visa,
              Mastercard and Amex.
            </p>
            <p>We take your personal security seriously. Transactions occur within
              the PayPal environment and are protected by their leading security and 24/7
              monitoring. PayPal are one of the most trusted internet payment systems
